**Project 1**

## Netflix is one of the largest providers of online streaming services. It collects a huge amount of data because it has a very large subscriber base.

**Netflix Data Analysis**
We can analyze a lot of data and models from Netflix because this platform has consistently focused on changing business needs by shifting its business model from on-demand DVD movie rental and now focusing a lot about the production of their original shows.

In this analysis, I’ll take a look at some very important models of Netflix data to understand what’s best for their business. Some of the most important tasks that we can analyze from Netflix data are:

understand what content is available
understand the similarities between the content
understand the network between actors and directors
what exactly Netflix is focusing on
and sentiment analysis of content available on Netflix.
The dataset I use for the Netflix data analytics task consists of TV shows and movies streamed on Netflix as of 2019.

**Project 2** 

Abstract
**Zomato is one of the best online food delivery apps** which gives the users the ratings and the reviews on restaurants all over india.These ratings and the Reviews are considered as one of the most important deciding factors which determine how good a restaurant is.

We will therefore use the real time Data set with variuos features a user would look into regarding a restaurant. We will be considering Banglore City in this analysis.

Content The basic idea of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to get a fair idea about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Bengaluru, aggregate rating of each restaurant, Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world.

With each day new restaurants opening the industry has’nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they don’t have time to cook for themselves.

With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. What kind of a food is more popular in a locality. Do the entire locality loves vegetarian food. If yes then is that locality populated by a particular sect of people for eg. Jain, Marwaris, Gujaratis who are mostly vegetarian. These kind of analysis can be done using the data, by studying the factors such as

• Location of the restaurant • Approx Price of food • Theme based restaurant or not • Which locality of that city serves that cuisines with maximum number of restaurants • The needs of people who are striving to get the best cuisine of the neighborhood • Is a particular neighborhood famous for its own kind of food.

“Just so that you have a good meal the next time you step out”

The data is accurate to that available on the zomato website until 15 March 2019. The data was scraped from Zomato in two phase. After going through the structure of the website I found that for each neighborhood there are 6-7 category of restaurants viz. Buffet, Cafes, Delivery, Desserts, Dine-out, Drinks & nightlife, Pubs and bars.

**Main Objective:**
The main agenda of this project is:

**Perform extensive "Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)" on the Zomato Dataset.**
